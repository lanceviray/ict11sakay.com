<h1>Mobile Phone Parts Name List and their Function</h1>
<h2></h2>
<ul>
<li><h4>"ANTENNA": is used to receive and transmit radio frequency. It is inbuilt in the cabinet of the mobile phone. These are called inbuilt antenna.</h4>
<li><h4>"BATTERY": is the only source of power supply to a mobile phone. Three types of battery are mostly used in mobile cell phones and Tablets</h4>
<li><h4>"BATTERY CHARGER": several types of Chargers are used to recharge the battery of a mobile cell phone. These include normal battery chargers, Travel Adaptor (TA), Cigar Lighter Adaptor (CLA) etc.</h4>
<li><h4>"Switch or Key Tip": These tiny switches are used for the key pad.</h4>
<li><h4>"CPU":The CPU is the Main Control Section of a mobile phone, Android Smartphone and Apple iPhone. It controls all the function and does all the processing work.</h4>
<li><h4>"RAM": is an erasable memory where older data and information can be erased and new data and information can be stored.</h4>
<li><h4>"ROM": A memory that can only be read. It cannot be erased. Programmable ROM (PROM) and Erasable ROM (EROM) are some other types of ROM Memory that can be erased.</h4>
<li><h4>"VISUAL DISPLAY": This part of the mobile phone generates light to display all information. Display of a cell phone can be classified as follows</h4>
<li><h4>"ANTENA SWITCH":It does the function of receiving, transmitting and switching of different frequencies like GSM, DCS and PCS.</h4>
<li><h4>"IF IC":This IC is also called Hager IC, MJOLNER IC and RF IC. It performs the function of amplification of receiving signal, mixing and demodulation.</h4>
<li><h4>VCO (Voltage Control Oscillator): Controls frequency.</h4>
<li><h4>:AUDIO IC":The main function of this IC is to handle and control audio frequency and produce sound.</h4>
<li><h4> (Universal Energy Module):
    It performs several functions like power supply, charging, audio processing, ringer, vibrator etc.</h4>
<li><h4>(Light Emitting Diode)
    It is used to produce light on keyboard and display.</h4>      
    <li><h4>"RF CRYSTAL":
        This is the main and very important crystal in any mobile phone. Crystals of mainly 13 MHz, 26 MHz, 19.2 MHz or 36.4 MHz are used in cell phones. The phone becomes dead if this crystal is faulty.</h4>
        <li><h4>:EAR SPEAKER":
            This Ear Speaker is mounted on the top side of the mobile phone. It helps to listen sound during incoming calls.</h4>
            <li><h4>"MICOPHONE":
                It converts voice signal to electric signal or tone signal during transmission. This signal is then sent to the Audio IC.</h4>
                <li><h4>VIBRATOR MOTOR
                    It Provides vibration alert during incoming calls or messages in silent mode or when the option is On.</h4>
                    <li><h4>"SIM card":
                        SIM stands for Subscriber Identity Module. It is used in GSM Mobile phones. There is a micro chip in this card in which all data and information related to the USER is stored. Without a SIM Card, a GSM phone is of no good use.</h4>
                        <li><h4>"SIM CARD SOCKET":
                            Holds the SIM card and acts like a SIM reader or SIM writer.</h4>
   <li><h4>"MEMORY CARD":
    External memory storage card used to store data such as photos, videos, audio etc. SD card, Mini SD Card and Micro SD cards are used as external memory.</h4>
    <li><h4> "EXTERNAL ANTENNA SOCKET":
        External antenna can be connected with the help of accessories in this socket. This helps to increase the range of internal antenna.</h4>
        <li><h4>":RETU IC":
            This module performs several important functions.</h4>
            <li><h4>:TAHVO IC":
                This module also performs several important functions.</h4>
                <li><h4>"OMAP MODULE":
                    Performs the function of processing application software and control UI software.</h4>
                    <li><h4>HANDS FREE CONNECTOR":
                        Helps to carry on conversation without holding the Phone in hand using Head Phone or Ear Phone.</h4>
